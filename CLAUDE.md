# DreamFinder — Claude Code Project Guide

## Working With Blake

If Blake asks you to do something and you know of a better approach —
whether it's a cleaner implementation, a simpler workflow, a tool that
would make the task easier, or a potential pitfall with the current
approach — **speak up before acting**. Briefly explain the alternative
and let him decide. Don't just silently execute what was asked if you
can see a better path.

## What DreamFinder Is
DreamFinder is a store-agnostic single-page tablet kiosk app for mattress showroom floors.
Customers take a 12-question sleep quiz, get personalized mattress recommendations across
Gold/Silver/Bronze tiers, browse accessories, and receive results + a discount code by email.
Salespeople get a handoff screen showing the customer's saved picks.

**DreamFinder is a white-label product.** The canonical app has no relationship to any
specific retailer. Each store gets its own fully customized deployment.

## This Repo — The Furniture Market of Texarkana (TFM) Deployment
Deployed at: https://beford782.github.io/TheFurnitureMarket/
Repo: https://github.com/beford782/TheFurnitureMarket

This is The Furniture Market's instance. Everything in `data/` is TFM-specific.
Do not treat any TFM-specific content (mattress models, branding, discount codes,
GAS endpoint) as a default or starting point for other retailers.

---

## White-Label Architecture — Critical Rules

### The store-agnostic boundary
`index.html` must contain zero store-specific content. No retailer names, logos,
colors, mattress models, or discount codes hardcoded in the HTML.

All store identity lives in two files only:
- `data/store-config.json` — branding, store name, colors, discount prefix, GAS URL
- `data/mattresses.csv` / `data/mattresses.json` — this store's mattress lineup

### Each retailer gets its own repo
Do not push TFM changes to another retailer's deployment.
Do not copy `data/mattresses.csv` between retailer repos — each store has a
completely different product lineup.

**Active deployments (separate repos):**
- Bel Furniture — beford782/DreamFinder (active)
- The Furniture Market of Texarkana — this repo (active)
- Star Furniture — separate repo (planned)
- Lacks Furniture — separate repo (planned)

### New features must be config-driven
Any feature that could vary by store (colors, copy, quiz questions, tier names,
email templates) must be driven by `store-config.json`, not hardcoded.
If you find yourself writing a store name or brand color into the HTML, stop —
it belongs in config.

### Quiz questions are currently hardcoded — known limitation
The 12 quiz questions and their answer options live in the HTML, not in config.
This is a known gap. Do not add more hardcoded store-specific question logic.
Flag any question customization requests as requiring a config migration first.

## App Architecture — Read Before Touching Anything

### Single-file HTML
`index.html` is the entire app. No separate JS or CSS files. Do not split it.

### Domain Lock
A domain lock at the top of the `<script>` block restricts where the app runs.
Allowed domains: `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` (TFM's GitHub Pages domain TBD — add when repo is created).
If deploying to a new domain, add it to the `allowed` array around line 3607.

### Data files
- `data/mattresses.csv` — source of truth for mattress lineup, edit this
- `data/mattresses.json` — generated file, never edit directly
- `data/store-config.json` — all store-specific configuration

The app fetches both JSON files at load time.

### Build script
```
.\build-data.ps1
```
Run from repo root. Converts `data\mattresses.csv` → `data\mattresses.json`.
Always run this before committing if the CSV was changed.
Never commit CSV changes without also committing the regenerated JSON.

## Mattress Data — CSV Column Reference

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `tier` | gold / silver / bronze |
| `id` | g1–g33, unique per deployment, never reuse |
| `name` | Model name |
| `brand` | Restonic (TFM-specific, other brands TBD) |
| `subBrand` | Sub-line (Copper, Last Mattress, etc.) |
| `firmnessScore` | 1–10 number used by scoring engine |
| `firmnessLabel` | Display text (Plush, Medium, Firm, etc.) |
| `price` | Leave blank — not displayed in app |
| `locally-made` | yes / no — affects scoring (see below) |
| `quizTags` | Pipe-delimited. Used by scoring engine as `features` in JSON |
| `displayBadges` | Pipe-delimited. 2–3 chips shown on card |
| `highlight` | One punchy line for the card hero (~10 words) |
| `features` | Long-form feature text for display |
| `reason_*` | Personalised match reason shown to customer per quiz answer |

---

## Scoring Engine — How Recommendations Work

Located in `index.html` around line 4040. Three scoring passes:

**1. Firmness (most important, max +50)**
Linear sliding scale: `firmScore = max(0, 50 - diff * 10)` where
`diff = |customerFirmness - mattressFirmness|`. So: diff 0 = +50,
diff 1 = +40, diff 2 = +30, diff 3 = +20, diff 4 = +10, diff 5+ = 0.
Additionally, if `diff ≥ 4` an extra **-20** penalty is applied,
so a diff of 4 nets -10 and a diff of 5+ nets -20.

**2. Feature matching**
Quiz answers map to feature tags via `opt.scores`. Each matching tag adds points.
Tags are stored in the JSON `features` array (mapped from `quizTags` in CSV).

**3. Locally made bonus (+25)**
If `m.locallyMade === true`, adds 25 points and appends a match reason.
In the TFM deployment: locally-made status TBD per mattress brand.
This value and logic may differ per retailer deployment.

Qualified results = top 3 models scoring ≥ 60% of the top score.

IMPORTANT: Do not modify scoring weights or logic without confirming with Blake.
This area has had significant prior tuning.

## Backend — Google Apps Script

Email delivery and lead logging use a Google Apps Script (GAS) web app.
The GAS endpoint URL lives in the HTML (search for `GOOGLE_SCRIPT_URL`).
Each retailer deployment has its own GAS script and endpoint.

If GAS needs redeployment: Manage Deployments → pencil icon → New version.
The GAS script builds email HTML server-side to avoid payload size limits.

---

## iPad / Touch Event Rules

The app runs on iPads in showrooms. These rules must be preserved in all deployments:
- `touch-action: manipulation` on all interactive elements
- Dynamic elements (mattress cards, buttons) need both `touchend` and `pointerdown` listeners
- `event.preventDefault()` on touchend handlers to prevent ghost clicks
- `location.reload()` must never be used — always call `window.startOver()` to reset

IMPORTANT: Do not change touch handling without confirming with Blake — this required
significant debugging to get right.

---

## Key App Flows (Don't Break These)

- **Quiz → Results**: 9 questions → scoring engine → Gold/Silver/Bronze tier tabs → top pick badge
- **Mattress drawer**: Opens on card tap. Prev/next navigation between results. Firmness bar, match reasons, features.
- **Accessories**: 3-step flow (Foundations → Pillows → Protectors). Sticky cart bar. Cart persists to handoff screen.
- **Discount reveal**: Dramatic animation — DREAM + 3-digit code. 10rem gold glow font.
- **Handoff screen**: Customer marks "I'm Interested" on mattresses/accessories. Salesperson sees saved picks.
- **Idle timeout**: Inactivity triggers reset flow back to start screen. Uses `window.startOver()`.

---

## Image Format Convention

**MUST:** all mattress and accessory images are `.jpg`, lowercase
kebab-case, no spaces, no underscores.

- ✅ `copper-ice-regular.jpg`, `kimber-firm.jpg`, `adjustable-4150.jpg`
- ❌ `Copper Ice Regular.png`, `kimber_firm.webp`, `AdjustableBase.PNG`

**Why:** Outlook desktop's Word render engine doesn't support `.webp`
at all, handles `.png` unreliably (especially with URL-encoded spaces
in the filename), and iOS Mail's Mail Privacy Protection is stricter
still. Customer results emails routinely ship product images, so any
image outside the jpg-kebab-case convention shows as a broken link.

**When adding a new mattress or accessory image:**
1. Save as `.jpg` at quality 85–90.
2. Filename lowercase, kebab-case, no spaces.
3. Drop into `images/mattresses/` or `images/accessories/`.
4. For accessories, reference the filename in `index.html`'s
   `ACCESSORIES` array.

**Converting existing webp or png assets:**
```python
from PIL import Image
Image.open('source.webp').convert('RGB').save('target.jpg', 'JPEG', quality=88, optimize=True)
```

`build-data.ps1` resolves extensions in order `jpg, png, webp`, so a
leftover `.webp` won't break anything — but new images should be jpg
from the start to avoid the email rendering gap.

## Deployment

```
git add .
git commit -m "description"
git push origin main --force
```

Force push is intentional — always used for this repo.
GitHub Pages updates within 1–2 minutes after push.

### IMPORTANT: Claude Code on the Web creates feature branches automatically
If this session is running in Claude Code on the web (claude.ai/code),
pushes default to a `claude/<name>-<id>` branch — NOT to main.
GitHub Pages only deploys from main, so those pushes do not go live.

**At the start of every session and before any commit/push, Claude MUST:**
1. Check the current branch with `git branch --show-current`
2. If the branch is anything other than `main`, warn Blake clearly that
   pushes on this branch will NOT deploy, and offer to either:
   - Push to main directly: `git push origin HEAD:main --force`, or
   - Use the `git ship` alias (already configured locally) which does the same

Never assume a push to a `claude/*` branch is a successful deployment.
Always confirm main was updated before reporting that a change is live.

## Division of Labour — Regular Claude vs Claude Code

**Regular Claude (claude.ai)** — design, logic, new features, producing updated
HTML and scripts. Works across sessions without access to the repo directly.

**Claude Code** — applying file changes, running build scripts, committing, pushing.

### Handoff workflow
When Regular Claude produces a new `index.html` or `build-data.ps1`:
1. Replace the existing file in the repo
2. If CSV was also updated, run `.\build-data.ps1` to regenerate the JSON
3. Verify no regressions in touch events, scoring, or GAS integration
4. Commit and push

### What Claude Code should never do without checking with Blake first
- Modify scoring weights or logic in the quiz engine
- Change touch event handling
- Hardcode any store-specific content into `index.html`
- Copy mattress data or config between retailer repos
- Edit `data/mattresses.json` directly (always regenerate from CSV)
- Add store names, colors, or branding anywhere except `store-config.json`
